# Inverted_Pendulum
A simple SIMULINK model to demonstrate the working of a PID controller to control the pendulum on a cart when the pendulum is disturbed from its equilibrium position
Look inside the PID subsystems to check the Kp,Ki,Kd gains
The dynamics of the system can be found inside the subsystem - Dynamics
