# Inverted_Pendulum
A simple SIMULINK model to demonstrate the working of a PID controller to control the pendulum on a cart when the pendulum is disturbed from its equilibrium position.
Look inside the PID subsystems to check the Kp,Ki,Kd gains.
The dynamics of the system can be found inside the subsystem - Dynamics.
The graph below shows what happens when the pendulum is disturbed from its rest position.
When an initial siplacement of theta 0.17 radians is given the controller tries to bring the theta value back to zero by changing the position of the cart.
